# Hi there 👋

I'm Anastasiia from Kyiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦

I’m currently transitioning into the world of DevOps, after working as a frontend developer for the past 4 years. My background is mainly in React, with a focus on building user-facing applications.

I'm learning DevOps because I'm genuinely curious about how code gets deployed to production — I want to understand the full lifecycle of software delivery, be on the same page with DevOps engineers, and be able to handle more things on my own.

## 💼 Background

- 🖥 4 years of experience as a Frontend Developer
- 🔧 Currently studying DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- 🎯 Goal: build a strong understanding of deployment pipelines and infrastructure
